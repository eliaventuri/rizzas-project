          Happy Birthday! ❤️🎁🎉 I know I copied your idea, but it still seemed
          like the nicest thing I could manage, and I really wanted to give you
          a gift. I had a few issues finishing it on time, so maybe some fixes
          and DLC are planned for the future. I hope you appreciate the effort!
